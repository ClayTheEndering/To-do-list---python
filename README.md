# To-do-list---python
A working to-do list in python to download, can work with saving into a file and loading it will also create the file, no mobile support unfortunately, if you would like any features let me know and I will code them up and make it for you. This has just been testing my coding skills I can try and do any other things it can do but for now here's a rundown:
- Create new task
- Load from file
- Save to file
- Remove tasks
- Mark tasks as complete
- Exit

If there is anything of interest you would like in your code, let me know I will happily share my code to help, give credit if you publish though, that's all really, let me know any ammendments you would like I am more than willing to do so.
